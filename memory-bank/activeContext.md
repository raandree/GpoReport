- Robust encoding handling and error recovery
- Multi-file processing with directory recursion

**Secondary Script**: `Search-GPOSettings.ps1`
- Handles PowerShell-exported GPO XMLs
- Simpler XML structure processing
- Maintained for completeness but GPMC version is primary focus

**Test Suite**: `Test-GPMCSearch.Tests.ps1` (369 lines)
- Comprehensive Pester test coverage
- Validates all mapping table requirements
- Automated regression prevention
- Real-world XML validation

### Current Working Directory Status

**Key Files**:
- `GpoReport/Search-GPMCReports.ps1` - Main production script
- `GpoReport/Test-GPMCSearch.Tests.ps1` - Complete test suite
- `GpoReport/mapping.txt` - Reference mapping table (25 patterns)
- `GpoReport/AllSettings1.xml` - Primary test data file (108KB)

**Test Data Collection**:
- 17 XML files across multiple directories
- Mix of GPMC exports and PowerShell exports
- Various sizes from 14KB to 341KB
- Real-world production GPO configurations

## Recent Decisions and Learnings

### Key Technical Decisions

**XML Processing Strategy**: Chosen namespace-aware processing over simpler text parsing
- **Rationale**: GPMC XMLs use complex Microsoft namespaces that require proper handling
- **Impact**: More complex code but significantly more accurate categorization

**Encoding Handling**: Implemented automatic UTF-16/UTF-8 detection and correction
- **Problem**: GPMC often declares UTF-16 but saves as UTF-8
- **Solution**: Try direct load, fallback to encoding correction on error
- **Result**: Robust handling of real-world file variations

**Category Detection**: Built hierarchical detection system with specialized functions
- **Security Settings**: `Get-SecuritySubcategory()` for Account/Local Policies distinction
- **Advanced Audit**: `Get-AuditSubcategory()` for proper audit categorization
- **Admin Templates**: Standard hierarchy path extraction
- **Impact**: 100% accuracy on mapping table validation

### Important Patterns Discovered

**Security Options Subcategorization**:
- Domain Controller settings need special "Domain Controller" subcategory
- Device settings get "Devices" subcategory
- Default fallback to "Other" for uncategorized security options

**Member Name Extraction**:
- User/group names in security settings often in `Member/Name` elements
- Need to extract actual names, not just element structure
- Critical for User Rights Assignment categorization

**Duplicate Prevention**:
- Same setting can appear multiple times in complex XMLs
- Implement filtering during processing, not post-processing
- Significantly improves performance and result clarity

## Next Steps and Considerations

### Immediate Priorities: **MEMORY BANK CREATION**

Currently creating comprehensive Memory Bank to document project state:
- ✅ `projectbrief.md` - Core requirements and scope
- ✅ `productContext.md` - Business context and user experience
- ✅ `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns  
- ✅ `techContext.md` - Technology stack and constraints
- 🔄 `activeContext.md` - Current state (this file)
- 🔄 `progress.md` - What works and what's left

### Maintenance and Enhancement

**Code Quality**: All scripts follow PowerShell best practices
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- Detailed help documentation
- Verbose output for troubleshooting
- Error handling with graceful degradation

**Testing Strategy**: Automated validation prevents regressions

## Project Insights

### What Works Exceptionally Well

**Namespace-Aware Processing**: The decision to properly handle XML namespaces was crucial
- Enables accurate detection of Security Settings vs Admin Templates
- Allows proper Advanced Audit Configuration identification
- Prevents false positives in category detection

**Hierarchical Category Detection**: Building category paths from XML structure is highly reliable
- XML hierarchy directly maps to GPO console organization
- Provides user-familiar category paths
- Enables precise troubleshooting guidance

**Robust Error Handling**: Real-world XML files have many variations
- Encoding issues handled transparently
- Missing elements don't break processing
- Partial results better than no results

### Lessons Learned

**Test-Driven Development**: Mapping table validation was essential
- Clear success criteria prevented scope creep
- Automated testing caught regressions immediately
- Real-world files revealed issues not found in simple test cases

**Documentation Investment**: Comprehensive docs pay long-term dividends
- Future maintenance will be easier
- Knowledge transfer is documented
- Troubleshooting guides reduce support burden

**Performance vs Accuracy**: Chose accuracy over raw speed
- Namespace-aware processing is slower but much more accurate
- Users prefer correct results over fast wrong results
- Performance is still acceptable for real-world use cases
